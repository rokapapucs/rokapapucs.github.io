# No-bake lemon cheesecake

![Picture of lemon cheesecake]({{ "/assets/images/lemon-cheesecake.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I got a little tip from my brother, that my mom would like lemon cheesecake for her birthday. Doing some research I
found that there are different kind of cheesecakes:
- you can choose to bake, or not to bake it in the oven
- only the filling contains lemon, or the filling is marbled with lemon curd

As the title suggests, this is a **no-bake** lemon cheesecake with **lemon curd**.

The result was a huge success in the family. Even my brother loved it from the first bite, in spite of the fact that
he does not like lemon-based cakes or cookies. The lemon flavour is not overwhelming in this cake, it's rather gentle.

A couple of weeks later the theme of the week for the [52 weeks of cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/) was citrus
and we decided to make this cake again. Folks over reddit liked it and asked for the recipe. As I was working from Hungarian
recipes, I decided to create a write-up in English as the first post in this blog.

My goal in this blog is to be specific in sharing my experiences, so it's easy for others to replicate and avoid some pitfalls. Hope you find this helpful!

## Structure

The cake has three components:
1. A solid **base** from biscuits
2. **Filling** made from mascarpone, white chocolate, lemon zest, and other great ingredients.
3. **Lemon-curd** topping to decorate and to give an extra dose of lemon taste.

## Ingredients

The amounts are originally for a 22 cm cake tin, but it worked in a 24 cm one. Feel free to adjust to your needs.

For the **base**
- 20 dkg ground oat-biscuits
  - you can use other types of biscuits
  - grind it in a food processor if you buy whole biscuits
- 10 dkg melted butter

For the **filling**
- 20 dkg white chocolate
- 50 dkg mascarpone
  - best to use room temperature mascarpone, your arms will thank you
- 2 dl cream
- zest of 1 lemon
- 1 packet of [vanilla sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_sugar)

For the **lemon curd**
- 5 dkg granulated sugar
- zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 1.5 dkg butter
- 1 egg

## Instructions

**Base**
1. Prepare a 24 cm cake thin with baking paper
2. Mix ground biscuits with melted butter in a bowl. Use a fork, spoon or spatula, you don't need an electronic mixer for this.
3. Lay the mixture in the bottom of the cake tin. Try to create a level surface (e.g. with a spatula).
4. Refrigerate.

**Lemon-curd**

1. Mix sugar with the zest and juice of the lemon in a heat-proof bowl or pot.
2. Place bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir until sugar is completely dissolved.
3. Mix in butter, let it melt in the mixture.
4. Cool the mixture down to room temperature. You can submerge the bowl in cold water to speed up the process,
but make sure to stir the mixture to cool down evenly.
5. Whisk in the egg.
6. Put bowl back to over simmering water, whisking regularly, until the mixture thickens. Be patient, this is going to take time. Make sure it's thick, you don't want it runny.
7. Let it cool down completely.

**Filling**

Similarly to the lemon-curd, we are going to use the heat of simmering water to melt chocolate.

1. Mix cream, vanilla sugar and chocolate in a heat-proof bowl.
2. Place bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Heat until chocolate is melted. Let it cool for a couple of minutes.
3. In a separate bowl mix mascarpone with lemon zest.
4. Slowly pour the melted chocolate mixture into the mascarpone, whisking it as you pour it to mix evenly.

**Combine the components**

1. Retrieve the base from the refrigerator.
2. Pour the filling on the biscuit base. Smooth is as much as you can.
3. Dollop lemon curd on the top of the filling, preferably in little spots.
4. With the handle of a spoon, or a chop-stick, draw lines through the filling and lemon curd dollops. Use your creativity to create marble patterns.
5. Refrigerate overnight.

## Variations

For a lighter taste, you can swap half of the mascarpone with cream cheese, ricotta or curd cheese.
