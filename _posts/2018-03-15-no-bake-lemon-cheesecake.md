# No-bake lemon cheesecake

![Picture of lemon cheesecake]({{ "/assets/images/lemon-cheesecake.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I got a hint from my brother that our mom would like lemon cheesecake for her birthday. After some research I
found that there are different kinds of cheesecakes:
- you can choose to bake or not to bake it in the oven
- you can add the lemon to the filling or just marble it with lemon curd  

As the title suggests, this is a **no-bake** lemon cheesecake with **lemon curd**.

The result was a huge success in the family. Even my brother loved it from the first bite, in spite of the fact that
he does not like lemon-based cakes or cookies. The lemon flavour is not overwhelming in this cake, it's rather gentle.

A couple of weeks later the theme of the week for the [52 weeks of cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/) was citrus
and we decided to make this cake again. Folks over reddit liked it and asked for the recipe. As I was working from Hungarian
recipes, I decided to create a write-up in English as the first post on this blog.

My goal with this blog is to be specific in sharing my experiences, so it's easy for others to follow and avoid pitfalls. Hope you find this helpful!

## Structure

The cake has three components:
1. A solid **base** from biscuits.
2. **Filling** made from mascarpone, white chocolate, lemon zest, and other great ingredients.
3. **Lemon-curd** topping to decorate and to give an extra kick of lemon taste.

## Ingredients

The amounts are originally for a 22 cm cake tin, but it worked fine in a 24 cm one too. Feel free to adjust tin size to your needs.

For the **base**
- 20 dkg ground oat-biscuits
  - you can use other types of biscuits
  - grind it in a food processor if you buy whole biscuits
- 10 dkg melted butter

For the **filling**
- 20 dkg white chocolate
- 50 dkg mascarpone
  - best to use room temperature mascarpone, your arms will thank you
- 2 dl cream
- zest of 1 lemon
- 1 packet of [vanilla sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_sugar)

For the **lemon curd**
- 5 dkg granulated sugar
- zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 1.5 dkg butter
- 1 egg

## Instructions

**Base**
1. Prepare a 24 cm cake tin with baking paper
2. Mix ground biscuits with melted butter in a bowl. Use a fork, spoon or spatula, you don't need an electronic mixer for this.
3. Lay the mixture in the bottom of the cake tin. Try to create a level surface (e.g. with a spatula).
4. Refrigerate.

**Lemon-curd**

1. Mix sugar with lemon zest and juice in a heat-proof bowl or pot.
2. Place bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir until sugar is completely dissolved.
3. Mix in butter, let it melt in the mixture.
4. Let the mixture cool to room temperature. You can submerge the bowl in cold water to speed up the process,
but make sure to stir the mixture to cool evenly.
5. Whisk in the egg.
6. Put bowl back over simmering water, and whisk regularly until the mixture thickens. Be patient, this is going to take time. Make sure it's thick, you don't want it runny.
7. Let it cool completely.

**Filling**

Similarly to the lemon-curd, we are going to use the heat of simmering water to melt chocolate.

1. Mix cream, vanilla sugar and chocolate in a heat-proof bowl.
2. Place bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Heat until chocolate is melted. Let it cool for a couple of minutes.
3. In a separate bowl mix mascarpone with lemon zest.
4. Slowly pour the melted chocolate mixture into the mascarpone, whisking it continuously to allow it to mix evenly.

**Combine the components**

1. Retrieve base from the refrigerator.
2. Pour the filling on the biscuit base. Smooth it as much as you can.
3. Dollop lemon curd on the top of the filling, preferably in little spots.
4. With the handle of a spoon or a chop-stick, draw lines in the filling and lemon curd dollops to create a marble effect. Use your creativity.
5. Refrigerate overnight.

## Variations

For a lighter taste, you can swap half of the mascarpone with cream cheese, ricotta or curd cheese.
