# Introduction

Welcome to this blog!

A little over a year ago we started participating in the [52 weeks of cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/) challenge on reddit. You can see the dishes submitted [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/rokapapucs).

That challenge was the start of a bigger journey, dipping toes into various cuisines, upgrading kitchen equipment, and overall, being open-minded and curious about cooking.

Now, the time has come to share some of the lessons learned. Expect recipes, reviews and general experiences related to cooking.

Stay tuned!
