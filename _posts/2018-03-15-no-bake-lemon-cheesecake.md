[types of lemon cheesecakes]

[Maybe start with reddit citrus week?]
I got this recipe from my mother to make for her birthday. I found some vartiations on the internet, and decided to create an English language write-up. Folks over reddit also liked it when we prepared for citrus week.

Even my brother that does not like lemony cakes complimented this cake. [what flavour?]

The cake has three components:
1. A solid biscuit-based foundation
2. Cream made from mascarpone, white chocolate, lemon zest, and other great ingredients.
3. Lemon-curd topping to decorate and to give an extra dose of lemon taste.

[preparation times]

## Ingredients

24 cm cake tin

For the **base**
- 20 dkg ground oat-biscuits
  - you can use other types of biscuits
  - grind it in a food processor if you buy whole biscuits
- 10 dkg melted butter

For the **cream**
- 20 dkg white chocolate
- 50 dkg mascarpone
- 2 dl cream
- zest of 1 lemon
- vanilla sugar

For the **lemon curd**
- 5 dkg caster(?) sugar
- zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 1.5 dkg butter
- 1 egg

## Instructions

**Base**
1. Prepare a 24 cm cake thin with baking paper
2. Mix the ground biscuits with melted butter with hands.
3. Lay the mixture in the bottom of the cake tin. Try to create a level surface (e.g. with a spatula).
4. Refrigerate.

**Lemon-curd**

1. Mix the sugar with the zest and juice of the lemon.
2. Heat it over steam until sugar is completely dissolved.
3. Mix in butter, let is melt in the mixture.
4. Cool the mixture down to room temperature. You can submerge the bowl in cold water, but make sure to stir the mixture to cool down evenly.
5. Whisk in the egg.
6. Put it back to heat over steam, whisking regularly, until the mixture thickens. Be patient, this is going to take time. Make sure it's a thick fluid, you don't want it to flow. ?
7. Cool down completely.

**Cream**

1. Mix cream, vanilla sugar and chocolate in a pan.
2. Heat the pan over steam until chocolate is melted. Let it cool for a couple of minutes.
3. In a separate bowl mix the mascarpone with lemon zest.
4. Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the mascarpone in a thin ray(?), whisking it heavily as you pour it.

**Combine the components**

1. Take out the base from the refrigerator.
2. Pour the cream on the biscuit base. Smooth is as much as you can.
3. Place little dollops of lemon curd on the top of the cream layer.
4. With the handle of a spoon, or a chop-stick, draw lines through the cream and lemon curd dollops. Use your creativity to create marble patterns.
5. Refrigerate overnight.

## Variations

Swap half of the mascarpone with cream cheese, ricotta or quark (turo?). ?
